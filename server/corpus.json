Some of the most popular ones include:\n\n- B'stila: This is a Moroccan dish that plays with both sweet and savory flavors. It's a kind of layered pie, with a lot of warqa dough layers, a layer with almonds, and a layer with pigeon.\n- Brochettes (kebabs): Brochettes are Moroccan, and North African in general, skewers, with the term being used to refer to skewers in general.\n- Couscous: Perhaps the best-known of all Moroccan foods is couscous, the staple food found across the North African cuisines, as well as in many kitchens worldwide today. It is made from semolina, which is a type of durum wheat. In Morocco specifically, couscous is often served with stewed vegetables, as well as meat. It can also be served as a final course of a meal.\n- Gazelle horns (Kaab el Ghazal): Don't let the name get you skipping any heartbeats - there are no real gazelle horns eaten in this dish! Instead, Kaab el Ghazal is actually a dessert dish, a crescent-shaped cookie to be precise.\n- Rfissa: Served during various different kinds of celebrations, especially to celebrate childbirth, rfissa is a chicken and lentils dish served over shredded msemen."
